Solutions Considered : 
while there are many approaches that can be considered for ths problem such reading the entire log file in the memory and work on it line by line, but this process
would be highly inefficient and take up much of memory thus second approach would to read the file line by line without loading it in the memory and making an early 
exit when we reach our desired destination/reach our input parameter.

another process can be parallel processing where the file is divided into chuncks and it would be loaded into the memory into chunks which makes it highle efficient
but it is hard to implement.

Steps to Run:
Load the log file in text/log format in the root directory
Since I have used pycharm in my case, I wrote the code in the script file in the src folder and ran the file in the terminal.
The custom input date is to be provided in the code/ script file.
The output generated is later stored in the output file that is autogenerated after the completion of the script file.
The output file is stored atuomatically in the Output folder.
